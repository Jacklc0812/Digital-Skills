  <h2>Article 1 - How Coronavirus Turned Me into a Tourist</h2>
  <p> If Hollywood has taught me anything (and I like to think it has), it’s that life in the big city is the furthest thing from dull. London. Paris. Tokyo. Each conjures the same ideas of hustle and/or bustle. The city dweller never rests. How could they? In the city there are always half a hundred things to do, people to see, and places to visit. And so the 21st century city slicker has little choice but to bounce between commitments in a doomed attempt to juggle the various aspects of their lives. Much like the pigeons they contend with on the street, they flit from place to place seemingly on a whim. From work, to the gym, to the pub, to university, and back to the pub again. To some, this lifestyle might seem nightmarishly exhausting but to others the blinding pace of city life is one of its most appealing aspects. I count myself among them.
  </p>
  <p> There is a certain romance associated with city living. A vibrancy and a feeling of being part of something greater. In the city everyone is simultaneously the protagonist of their own story and a mere extra in everyone else’s. The anonymity and independence afforded by city life is a far cry from life in more suburban or rural areas in which a far greater emphasis is placed on community. I must confess that I have never particularly enjoyed the idea of all my neighbours knowing my business and have instead always been partial to the romantic idea of city life. You can imagine my dismay then, when I moved to the heart of Glasgow just in time for the Covid-19 pandemic to put a firm halt on the exciting, fast-moving lifestyle I had envisioned for myself.</p>
  <p> At the time of writing it is almost exactly a year since the World Health Organisation officially <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-in-charts-one-year-since-the-coronavirus-outbreak-was-declared-a-global-pandemic-12242044">classified the Covid-19 crisis as being a pandemic</a>. In that time, the restrictions necessary to slow the spread of coronavirus have led to some drastic changes to the way in which we live our lives. Our transition into this “new normal” has not been an easy one for most people. At the outset of the pandemic, I was bullish in believing that it would be fairly easy to maintain and adhere to social distancing measures. This was certainly the case at the beginning, when lockdown and Zoom calls were still novel, but as the months have worn on, so too have the restrictions been wearing on me. Oddly, I have found that the mild inconveniences have become almost as annoying as the greater sacrifices. For instance, something as trivial as a haircut is now considered an important issue for a great number of people, myself included. Perhaps it is because hair growth is a clear visual indication for how long the pandemic has been going, or maybe it is human nature to miss the little luxuries. In either case, it is clear from looking at me that a trip to the barbers is certainly in order.

  <p> Whilst undoubtedly only a minor nuisance, the closure of hairdressers is a symptom of the larger impact of coronavirus and social distancing. Namely, that with businesses shut, there are very few reasons to leave the house anymore. Particularly during the early days of the pandemic, when online technologies were largely responsible for our social lives, the streets of Glasgow were almost entirely bereft of people and their noise. A city that rarely slept before was now narcoleptic. In addition to the comparatively empty streets, the anonymity that I had once valued so highly was also now a burden as the combination of face-coverings and social distancing greatly diminished the quality of everyday interactions.
  </p>
<p>It was around this time that social media was awash with people claiming that the lockdown may encourage people to slow down and appreciate the world around them. A great many articles written during the first lockdown period echo this sentiment and speak to the psychological benefits that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52479763">nature can provide</a>. Whilst I was aware of these benefits, I was sceptical as to whether a wander through the city would have the same effect as a woodland walk. In fact, my first few lockdown excursions were decidedly more depressing than they were life affirming. The harsh contrast between the usual vibrancy of city-life and the dour, muted quality of life post-corona did not make for fun outings. I distinctly remember one such walk taking me to the top of Buchanan Street. A preacher was standing on the steps of the concert hall, reciting a memorised Bible passage to no-one in particular. The few others out on the street looked like the survivors of some calamity, complete with masks and a general sense of malaise. The entire scene was bathed in Glasgow rain and there was no sound at all,<span class="soundcite" data-id="1012466260" data-start="0" data-end="35836" data-plays="1">save for the sermon and the distant wail of some alarm.</span>The eeriness was almost profound enough as to deter me from future walks, but alas I do still have to eat and so it was soon necessary for me to take to the streets once again. And I have to say I’m rather glad I did.
</p>

<p>It would be a lie to say that on my very next trip I achieved some kind of enlightenment. There was no moment of revelation, only a gradual, growing appreciation for the city itself. Over time, as I walked the empty streets, I came to notice aspects of the city that I had never noticed before. Streets that I had never before paid any attention to now struck me as important. Architecture that once blended into the background now stood out as being beautiful. I watched the seasons change and saw the city take on new qualities with them. Autumn brought with it fresh colours as fallen leaves lined the streets near the cathedral, and Glasgow Green became Glasgow White during the February snows. As I walked the streets during these times, I half-expected to spontaneously develop an American accent or find that a selfie-stick had magically appeared in my hands. I had, without even realising it, become a tourist in my own city.
</p>

<p>But there was still something missing. Because for as beautiful as the city looked in the snow, there was a certain coldness that could not be wholly attributed to the weather. The warmth of human connection, typically so common in Glasgow, was absent. You see, there is a kindness to Glasgow. An empathy that is perhaps not typical of cities in the United Kingdom. After all, the city’s slogan since 2013 has been <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people-make-glasgow-announced-citys-new-slogan-1569746">"People Make Glasgow"</a> and the city has been twice voted as being the <a href="https://www.roughguides.com/articles/the-worlds-friendliest-cities-as-voted-by-you/">world's most friendly city</a>. It should come as no surprise then, that the near-empty streets were lacking in personality. In the midst of lockdown, it seemed as though the only people on the streets were those with nowhere else to go, and the new militia of bicycle couriers racing from place to place. The diversity that makes Glasgow such an interesting and vibrant place had been placed on hold and what remained was samey and soulless by comparison. It seemed like a problem that would persist until restrictions were fully lifted, but then, sometime in mid-March, the unthinkable happened. The sun came out.
</p>

<p>Glaswegians have always had an odd relationship with warm weather. A South American friend of mine once compared us to lizards always trying to bask in the sun. And as I walked around on that first sunny day in March, I saw that it was a behaviour that had not been forgotten over lockdown. People came out in droves and rushed to fill Glasgow’s outdoor spaces. I myself was one of them as I travelled to Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow’s West End to meet up with some friends. At the park, we were met with a scene that was startlingly normal. Groups of friends reclined together on the hillside whilst a <span class="soundcite" data-id="1012473640" data-start="33000" data-end="63839" data-plays="1">saxophonist serenaded them from below.</span>The skatepark was full. There was even an ice-cream truck. In the sunshine, the pandemic was all but forgotten. Yes, the musician played “Careless Whisper” a few too many times, and there were plenty of people in need of a haircut, but I would gladly take those problems instead of the boredom and unease that result from lockdown. On the way back from Kelvingrove, I noticed that the positive atmosphere had spread throughout the whole city, from Sauchiehall Street to Glasgow Green.

<p>The personality of the city had returned and appeared more rejuvenated than ever. For the first time, it seemed as if the end of the coronavirus pandemic might finally be within sight.
</p>

<p>Many articles have noted that the pandemic has driven many people away from cities <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-gen-z-leaving-cities-for-suburbs-amid-pandemic-2020-11?r=US&IR=T">towards the suburbs</a>. But having lived in Glasgow during the pandemic and seen it change in sunshine, snow and rain (well, mostly just rain), I have found that, for me, the opposite is true. And whilst I wait for the hubbub of city life to return, I count myself very lucky that this particular city is a strong enough character to tide me over until then.

<h3>Article 2 - Statistics and the Invisible Impact of Coronavirus</h3>

<p>It can be easy to think selfishly during this pandemic. After all, we have all been forced to make significant sacrifices in the name of a greater good that is difficult to observe. Given that viral spread is imperceivable to the human eye, the Covid-19 pandemic, despite its universal coverage over the past year, remains a somewhat abstract concept in the minds of most people. This is one of the fundamental problems when it comes to tackling an invisible enemy such as coronavirus. Governments, newspapers, and public health organisations have done their best to provide clear and accurate information regarding the virus, but no matter how many images we see of healthcare workers clad in PPE or how often we are reminded of social distancing guidelines, it remains almost impossible to properly grasp the scale of this pandemic. The situation calls to mind a quote famously attributed to Josef Stalin - <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195381214.001.0001/acprof-9780195381214-chapter-10#:~:text=It%20cites%20Joseph%20Stalin's%20quote,if%20they%20were%20non%2DAmerican.">"A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic"</a>. But whilst I broadly agree that it is easier for human beings to empathise with individuals compared to the collective, I also believe that statistics can be an extremely effective tools that can greatly enhance the narratives of news articles and public health literature, provided they are utilised in the correct way. In this article I intend to use statistics to highlight particular aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic that would otherwise be difficult to observe.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious example of a statistic utilised during the coronavirus pandemic is also one that I believe largely fails in properly informing an audience. The running death count of individuals who have died following a Covid-19 diagnosis was once a hard-hitting reminder of the pandemic’s severity. However, over the course of the year-long pandemic, the impact of this statistic has diminished significantly. It has been reduced to little more than a formality, delivered by politicians using the same rote phrases and expressions of sympathy. I believe that presenting the information in this manner robs the statistics of their power and reduces them to mere numbers. Instead, I think that more care should be taken to contextualise the data and ensure that it is closely related to more tangible aspects of the story which will automatically make the information more compelling to an audience. There is also an issue with scale as people may struggle to comprehend the impact across the whole of the United Kingdom. As such, I think that reporting on deaths in localised areas would be a more effective means of conveying the true impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as it is simply more affecting to hear news about your own community.
</p>
<p>Consider Glasgow as an example. Having lived here over the course of the pandemic I can tell you that it is impossible to walk the streets and see the human cost of coronavirus with the naked eye. Unless you personally know someone who has died as a result of Covid-19, or are a healthcare worker, you simply won’t understand. You will instead see the other downsides of the pandemic: the closed businesses, the masks, the social distancing, and the dreaded Zoom calls. In fact, it was only really whilst carrying out my research for this article, that I started to gain some idea of the terrible damage caused by coronavirus. On the 23rd of March 2021, the BBC posted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-52441285">an article</a> that paid tribute to those that had died in the year since the start of the first lockdown. I found this touching article to be extremely effective in conveying the cost of coronavirus and believe that it serves as a poignant reminder of why our small, personal sacrifices are required. Below I have created a storyline of Covid-19 deaths in Glasgow that includes significant milestones as well as some of the tributes featured in the BBC article. It is my hope that by presenting the data in this way, it will help highlight the human cost that lies behind the statistics.
</p>

<p>Statistics were all obtained from the <a href="https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Fcoronavirus-covid-19-management-information">Scottish Government Website</a>.
</p>
<p>But whilst deaths are undoubtedly the most important, they are not the only invisible impact of coronavirus. As alluded to previously, the pandemic has also had significant consequences when it comes to the business sector as the lockdown restrictions have forced many businesses, particularly those within the hospitality, tourism, and retail industries, to close. Government grants and the furlough scheme have eased some of the burden, but in many cases it is simply not enough. Various reports have been published that detail the extent of the damage caused by the business downtime. <a href="https://www.visitscotland.org/research-insights/coronavirus-insights/industry-impact">One such report</a>, conducted by the Scottish Tourism Emergency Response Group, found that 76% of businesses surveyed reported that they had been forced to reduce their staff numbers as a direct consequence of the pandemic. Perhaps worst of all is the fact that many of these businesses clearly anticipate that the situation will grow worse before it gets any better. They are running out of cash reserves and the lack of trade is making it difficult to keep employees on the payroll. Layoffs made during this time have been particularly devastating as very few businesses are in the position of being able to take on additional staff. Whilst bad enough in their own right, the grim statistics point towards an even larger problem as the stress and lack of security may herald a mental health crisis to accompany the financial one.
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, health professionals have stressed that the lockdowns may have a significant adverse effect towards people’s mental health. The isolation and loneliness of lockdown living, in conjunction with financial worries and the stress induced by the threat of a serious disease, have created an environment in which mental health can really suffer. Whilst various public health campaigns from both governments and charities have offered advice on how best to manage mental health during this difficult time, reports have nonetheless found that many UK citizens are struggling to cope. <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/research/coronavirus-mental-health-pandemic">A long-term investigation</a> conducted by the Mental Health Foundation has chronicled responses from UK citizens since the beginning of the pandemic and have concluded that mental health has indeed declined over that period. The report included worrying statistics such as the fact that feelings of loneliness had risen from 10% to 25% between March and November, and that reports of suicidal thoughts have risen from 8% to 13% from April to November. This all comes at a time when coronavirus has <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-10-2020-covid-19-disrupting-mental-health-services-in-most-countries-who-survey">disrupted the mental health services</a> in the vast majority of countries around the world, fuelling fears of a mental health epidemic.
</p>

<p>The final area I would like to discuss when it comes to the invisible effects of coronavirus is education. As both of my parents have jobs in education I have witnessed first-hand the difficulties of the transition into online learning, particularly when it comes to schools with large class sizes. Over the internet it is simply not possible to provide each child with the same level of support and attention that they would receive in a classroom setting. Add on to this the inherent difficulties when it comes to ensuring that children stay motivated in an environment where they will be subjected to a whole host of distractions that would not be present at school. Children may also be finding the lockdowns challenging as they will surely be missing friends and the structure that schooling provides. In some cases, children may also be exposed to abuse at home which may now go unnoticed. Indeed, during the first half of 2020 there was a 27% increase in the number of <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/serious-incident-notifications">serious incident reports involving children</a>. Teachers set to return to work have also raised safety concerns as teaching is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/feb/22/teaching-unions-warn-against-big-bang-return-to-school">high-risk position</a> where they are likely to come into contact with the virus. Teachers who are older or who have pre-existing medical conditions are particularly worried that simply going to work may put them at a significant risk.
</p>
<p>With a crisis as large as the Covid-19 pandemic, it can sometimes feel overwhelming. Across the entire planet, coronavirus has disrupted almost every aspect of our lives. But there is still hope on the horizon, for there is one statistic that is currently eliciting a far more positive response from the public than any other I have mentioned. I am talking, of course, about the UK vaccine rollout which seems to have arrived at a time when most of us were on the verge of forgetting what good news sounds like. More than simply being the most effective mechanism for thwarting coronavirus, vaccine progress also represents a timeline for when life will start to return to normal again. And I think I speak for all of us when I say that day can’t come soon enough.
</p>
<p>To end on a positive note, I have created a visualisation of the Scottish coronavirus vaccinations that have occurred so far. We're getting there, slowly but surely. </p>
