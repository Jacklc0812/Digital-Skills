  <h2>Article 1 - How Coronavirus Turned Me into a Tourist</h2>
  <p> If Hollywood has taught me anything (and I like to think it has), it’s that life in the big city is the farthest thing from dull. London. Paris. Tokyo. Each conjures the same ideas of hustle and/or bustle. The city dweller never rests. How could they? In the city there are always half a hundred things to do, people to see, and places to visit. And so the 21st century city slicker has little choice but to bounce between commitments in a doomed attempt to juggle the various aspects of their lives. Much like the pigeons they contend with on the street, they flit from place to place seemingly on a whim. From work, to the gym, to the pub, to university, and back to the pub again. To some, this lifestyle might seem nightmarishly exhausting but to others the blinding pace of city life is one of its most appealing aspects. I count myself among them.
  </p>
  <p> There is a certain romance associated with city living. A vibrancy and a feeling of being part of something greater. In the city everyone is simultaneously the protagonist of their own story and a mere extra in everyone else’s. The anonymity and independence afforded by city life is a far cry from life in more suburban or rural areas in which a far greater emphasis is placed on community. I must confess that I have never particularly enjoyed the idea of all of my neighbours knowing my business and have instead always been partial to the romantic idea of city life. You can imagine my dismay then, when I moved to the heart of Glasgow just in time for the Covid-19 pandemic to put a firm halt on the exciting, fast-moving lifestyle I had envisioned for myself.</p>
  <p> At the time of writing it is almost exactly a year since the World Health Organisation officially <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-in-charts-one-year-since-the-coronavirus-outbreak-was-declared-a-global-pandemic-12242044">classified the Covid-19 crisis as being a pandemic</a>. In that time, the restrictions necessary to slow the spread of coronavirus have led to some drastic changes to the way in which we live our lives. Our transition into this “new normal” has not been an easy one for most people. At the outset of the pandemic, I was bullish in believing that it would be fairly easy to maintain and adhere to social distancing measures. This was certainly the case at the beginning, when lockdown and Zoom calls were still novel, but as the months have worn on, so too have the restrictions been wearing on me. Oddly, I have found that the mild inconveniences have become almost as annoying as the greater sacrifices. For instance, something as trivial as a haircut is now considered an important issue for a great number of people, myself included. Perhaps it is because hair growth is a clear visual indication for how long the pandemic has been going, or maybe it is human nature to miss the little luxuries. In either case, it is clear from looking at me that a trip to the barbers is certainly in order.

  <p> Whilst undoubtedly only a minor nuisance, the closure of hairdressers is a symptom of the larger impact of coronavirus and social distancing. Namely, that with businesses shut, there are very few reasons to leave the house anymore. Particularly during the early days of the pandemic, when online technologies were largely responsible for our social lives, the streets of Glasgow were almost entirely bereft of people and their noise. A city that rarely slept before was now narcoleptic. In addition to the comparatively empty streets, the anonymity that I had once valued so highly was also now a burden as the combination of face-coverings and social distancing greatly diminished the quality of everyday interactions.
  </p>
<p>It was around this time that social media was awash with people claiming that the lockdown may encourage people to slow down and appreciate the world around them. A great many articles written during the first lockdown period echo this sentiment and speak to the psychological benefits that nature can provide. Whilst I was aware of these benefits, I was sceptical as to whether a wander through the city would have the same effect as a woodland walk. In fact, my first few lockdown excursions were decidedly more depressing than they were life affirming. The harsh contrast between the usual vibrancy of city-life and the dour, muted quality of life post-corona did not make for fun outings. I distinctly remember one such walk taking me to the top of Buchanan Street. A preacher was standing on the steps of the concert hall, reciting a memorised Bible passage to no-one in particular. The few others out on the street looked like the survivors of some calamity, complete with masks and a general sense of malaise. The entire scene was bathed in Glasgow rain and there was no sound at all.</p>
   <span class="soundcite" data-id="1012466260" data-start="0" data-end="35836" data-plays="1">save for the sermon and the distant wail of some alarm</span>
<p>. The eerieness was almost profound enough as to deter me from future walks but alas I do still have to eat and so it was soon necessary for me to take to the streets once again. And I have to say I’m rather glad I did.
</p>

<p>It would be a lie to say that on my very next trip I achieved some kind of enlightenment. There was no moment of revelation, only a gradual, growing appreciation for the city itself. Over time, as I walked the empty streets, I came to notice aspects of the city that I had never noticed before. Streets that I had never before paid any attention to now struck me as important. Architecture that once blended into the background now stood out as being beautiful. I watched the seasons change and saw the city take on new qualities with them. Autumn brought with it fresh colours as fallen leaves lined the streets near the cathedral, and Glasgow Green became Glasgow White during the February snows. As I walked the streets during these times, I half-expected to spontaneously develop an American accent or find that a selfie-stick had magically appeared in my hands. I had, without even realising it, become a tourist in my own city.
</p>

<p>But there was still something missing. Because for as beautiful as the city looked in the snow, there was a certain coldness that could not be wholly attributed to the weather. The warmth of human connection, typically so common in Glasgow, was absent. You see, there is a kindness to Glasgow. An empathy that is perhaps not typical of cities in the United Kingdom. After all, the city’s slogan since 2013 has been “People Make Glasgow” and the city has been twice voted as being the world’s most friendly city. It should come as no surprise then, that the near-empty streets were lacking in personality. In the midst of lockdown it seemed as though the only people on the streets were those with nowhere else to go, and the new militia of bicycle couriers racing from place to place. The diversity that makes Glasgow such an interesting and vibrant place had been placed on hold and what remained was samey and soulless by comparison. It seemed like a problem that would persist until restrictions were fully lifted but then, sometime in mid-March, the unthinkable happened. The sun came out.
</p>

<p>Glaswegians have always had an odd relationship with warm weather. A South-American friend of mine once compared us to lizards always trying to bask in the sun. And as I walked around on that first sunny day in March, I saw that it was a behaviour that had not been forgotten over lockdown. People came out in droves and rushed to fill Glasgow’s outdoor spaces. I myself was one of them as I travelled to Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow’s West-end to meet up with some friends. At the park, we were met with a scene that was startlingly normal.</p>
<span class="soundcite" data-id="1012473640" data-start="33000" data-end="63839" data-plays="1">Groups of friends reclined together on the hillside whilst a saxophonist serenaded them from below</span>
<p>. The skatepark was full. There was even an ice-cream truck. In the sunshine, the pandemic was all but forgotten. Yes, the musician played “Careless Whisper” a few too many times, and there were plenty of people in need of a haircut, but I’d gladly take those problems instead of the boredom and unease that result from lockdown. On the way back from Kelvingrove, I noticed that the positive atmosphere had spread throughout the whole city, from Sauchiehall Street to Glasgow Green. Insert Story map. The personality of the city had returned and appeared more rejuvenated than ever. For the first time, it seemed as if the end of the coronavirus pandemic might finally be within sight.
</p>

<p>Many articles have noted that the pandemic has driven many people away from cities towards the suburbs. But having lived in Glasgow during the pandemic and seen it change in sunshine, snow and rain (well, mostly just rain), I have found that, for me, the opposite is true. And whilst I wait for the hubbub of city life to return, I count myself very lucky then, that this particular city is a strong enough character to tide me over until then.
